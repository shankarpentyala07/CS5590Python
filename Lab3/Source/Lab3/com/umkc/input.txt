The UMKC has students of diverse cultures and you make good amount of friends and get toknow about their traditions and beliefs. There are a good number of student clubs in our college and most of them are located in the student union. I believe that there is a club for African students in which you can join and also most of the events happen in the student union. The union is at a walking distance from the college library and there are various food restaurants.
